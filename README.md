# Tic-Tac-Toe Poetry Game Simulation

This project simulates a tic-tac-toe-like game where players place tokens with words on both sides, aiming to create meaningful messages or small poems. The game ends when a player aligns four tokens in a row or the board fills up, allowing for both long and short message creations.

It was developed as part of an art project by the artist Roquekes, aiming to blend tic-tac-toe game mechanics with language and poetry.

## Installation

To clone this repository and run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tmfb/Tic-Tac-Toe-Poetry-Game-Simulation.git
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe-Poetry-Game-Simulation
   ```
2. Execute the `main.py` file from the command line:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Upon executing the `main.py` file, you will be prompted to engage with the simulation. Follow the instructions to place your tokens and explore the various game-ending states, or set a number of games for the AI to play, providing you with the endgame board arrangement for each game.

You can edit the main variables under the "config variables" section in `main.py` using any text editor. These variables include board size, weight matrix, random variable weight, and the color streak modifier.

Keep in mind that this project was built using the most basic tools of the language for didactic purposes, as the artist for whom this script was developed wanted to learn the basics of Python to understand the logic behind this part of his artwork development.

## Acknowledgments

Speciall thanks to Rokekes for presenting me his often unconventional ideas. It's always interesting to work while problem solving and having to think outside the box.
